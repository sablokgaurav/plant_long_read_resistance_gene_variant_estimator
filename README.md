# plant_long_read_resistance_gene_variant_estimator
This contains a complete workflow for the estimation of variant estimators from the long reads and it estimates using the NBS LRR specific resistance genes. This takes a long read sequencing from PacBio and Oxford Nanopore and estimates the variants and then plots the variants across the chromosomes. You dont have to search for the NBS LRR genes, it automatically has a pre-compiled NBS LRR gene precompiled from several previously published studies and it estimates the variants across the consensus.
